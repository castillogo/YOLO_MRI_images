I do not claim aouthorship for the scripts in this repository! 

These scripts are taken from https://github.com/AntonMu/TrainYourOwnYOLO

The original Redme file with the detailed description on how tu use these YOLO scripts can also be found here https://github.com/castillogo/YOLO_MRI_images/blob/master/TrainYourOwnYOLO-master/TrainYourOwnYOLO/README.md
